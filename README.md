# DeepAlgo Multi-Asset Reinforcement Learning Framework

This project provides a modular reinforcement learning framework designed for multi-asset trading environments.  
It integrates **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** agents with **candlestick pattern-based prediction models** to simulate and train intelligent market strategies across different asset classes.

---

## Features
- Multi-asset environment support
- PPO agent training and evaluation
- Candlestick pattern feature extraction
- Modular structure for easy extension
- Configurable risk management and execution layers
- Backtesting and evaluation tools included

## Quick Start

Example of loading an environment and training a PPO agent:

```python
from multi_asset_framework.envs import YourCustomEnv
from multi_asset_framework.models import PPOTrainer

env = YourCustomEnv(config_path="path/to/config.yaml")
trainer = PPOTrainer(env)
trainer.train()
```

*(Sample code will be expanded soon.)*
